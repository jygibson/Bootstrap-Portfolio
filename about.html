                            <p class="card-text">Welcome! This site began as one of my first homework
                                assignments for my coding bootcamp, and has evolved to the portfolio you see today. I'm
                                proud of
                                what I've created so far,
                                had plenty of fun with it, and hope you enjoy my work as well.</p>
                            <p>A little background about me: I am from Virginia, outside of Washington, DC and moved to
                                Florida in
                                October 2017.
                                I hold a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology from Christopher Newport University in Newport
                                News,
                                Virginia, and
                                have my Senior Professional in Human Resources certification. In addition to this, I
                                now
                                hold a
                                certification
                                in Full Stack Web Development from the UCF Coding Bootcamp.
                                For the past 9 years, I've worked in Human Resources for a law firm in Alexandria,
                                Virginia, where
                                I have
                                been supported by a great team and learned a lot.</p>

                            <p>I've always wanted to learn to code even from my early days playing around with
                                Geocities
                                sites and
                                Comic Sans font, but always
                                thought maybe it wasn't for me. However, I got the itch to do something new
                                professionally,
                                and
                                decided it was time to
                                take the plunge and
                                enrolled with the UCF Coding Boot Camp. I've learned so much through the bootcamp
                                including
                                HTML,
                                CSS, Bootstrap,
                                Javascript, jQuery, Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, Firebase, MongoDB, React and more. I'm
                                looking
                                forward to continuing to develop my skills in a professional environment
                                and
                                continuing to learn new languages.</p>
                            <p>I am a leader with excellent teamwork and communication skills, and I'm quick to learn
                                new
                                things
                                and adapt
                                to changes. I enjoy new challenges and
                                believe that my desire to put my newfound coding skills to work, along with my variety
                                of
                                work
                                experiences will allow
                                to me to be an asset to any organization.

                        <p> On a more personal level, I enjoy all kinds of things from cooking and baking to reading,
                            rowing and paddleboarding to coding, and
                            discovering new things about Florida to laying around watch trash television. I'm obsessed with
                            skin care, love changing my hair color
                            and did I mention I like
                            coding? </p>
