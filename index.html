        <p>Welcome to my coding portfolio! I'm glad you're here. This personal site began as one of my first homework
          assignments at the UCF Coding Bootcamp, and has evolved to now house all of my homeworks and projects to
          date. I'm proud of what I've created so far, had plenty of fun with it, and hope you enjoy them as well.</p>
        <p>A little background about me: I am from Northern Virginia, outside of Washington, DC and moved to Florida in
          October 2017 in order to try something new.
          I hold a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology from Christopher Newport University in Newport News, Virginia, and
          have my Senior Professional in Human Resources certification.
          For the past 9 years, I've worked in Human Resources for a law firm in Alexandria, Virginia, where I have
          been supported by a great team and learned a lot.</p>
        <p>I've always wanted to learn to code even from my early days playing around with Geocities sites, but always
          thought maybe it wasn't for me. However, I got the itch to do something new professionally, and decided to
          take the plunge and
          enrolled with the UCF Coding Boot Camp. I've learned so much already including HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, media
          queries, Javascript, jQuery, API calls, and Firebase. I'm looking forward to developing my skills and
          continuing to learn as the
          program continues!</p>
        <p>I am a leader with excellent teamwork and communication skills, and I'm quick to learn new things and adapt
          to changes. I enjoy new challenges and
          believe that putting my newfound coding skills to work, along with my variety of work experiences will allow
          to me to be an asset to your organization.
