                    <p>HELLOOOO and welcome to my portfolio project! I'm glad you're here. This is my first homework assignment and I'm pretty stoked about it. I'm excited to learn some new skills!</p>
                    <p> I am from Northern Virginia (many people think its important to point out "northern", but there's also people who think West Virginia is part of Virgina so...whatever.) outside of Washington, DC and moved to Florida in October 2017 - because we felt like it.  I have a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology from Christopher Newport University. For the past 8 years, I've worked in Human Resources for a law firm in Alexandria, Virginia, which luckily still employees me remotely here in Florida. In 2016, I earned my Senior Professional in Human Resources Certification, and that was the thing I most stoked about until I began the UCF Coding Boot Camp.</p>
                    <p> Besides learning to code, I spend my free time rowing with the South Orlando Rowing Association, training for my second half-marathon, beaching, and exploring Florida.  Another hobby of mine is skin care, and I also am a rep for the beauty brand Glossier. I also enjoy spending time with my husband, cooking, and watching any Real Housewives franchise. At this point, I'm still typing just to take up content space to get this to wrap around my picture better. </p>
